1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,720
Hey, Rex here with 2 in Oklahoma here in Dallas.

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,200
I ran into Felipe Smadje.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,320
The Spanish trials rider.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,400
That's right.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,600
You may have seen these guys on America's Got Talent.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,240
How long have you guys been riding?

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,680
We've been riding since we were around 10 or 11, so about 13 or 14 years.

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,680
Wow, okay.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,320
Going to town for quite a while now, but to ride trials, it takes that long to even ride the bike.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
Exactly.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,760
It takes a long time, but once you get to that level, it's one of the most fun sports you can do.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,080
It is a lot of fun.

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,160
It's great exercise, too.

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,320
And I understand you guys compete, right?

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,360
Yeah, we actually, I try to compete.

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,160
My brother, he competes very well.

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,800
He's the four time national champion.

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,600
I hold my own.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,160
I ride pro class very long with him, but usually he's at the front of the pack.

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,400
I'm just trying to beat a couple of guys.

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,960
We're both in there, though, both competing.

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,360
So what's been the reaction?

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,560
I mean, I bet all the guys, like Sherco and Gas Gas, the guys that make trials bikes,

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,160
probably just think you're the greatest thing to come along.

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,560
I mean, have you increased awareness of the sport?

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,120
Yeah, that was actually not only increased awareness of the sport,

27
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,240
because that was one thing that we really shoot for, because I mean, we love the sport.

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,920
We love to spread it.

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,840
That's kind of why we travel around doing demos, I mean, to bring the sport to new people.

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,960
And there's no better medium than national live television.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,800
So not only were we able to bring and grow what we're doing in our shows and our name,

32
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,720
but also the sport of trials and then even motorcycle as a whole,

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,480
because it's got a very negative aspect by a lot of the world.

34
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,440
They think of motorcycles, they think of pollution, they think of death, they think of injury.

35
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,960
And by what we did, we were able to bring it into a tight, confined area,

36
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,120
indoor in a building in downtown L.A.

37
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,160
So by jumping these barriers, we were able to open some eyes and make people realize

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,000
that maybe the motorcycles aren't such a bad thing.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,560
And so that was a really big thing that we brought from the show is a really cool

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,200
experience and to be able to open up people's eyes in that aspect was really awesome.

41
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,080
And you scored a gig at like the International Motorcycle Show.

42
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,120
And we're here after it, so you know, it was all good for sure.

43
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,160
So you're going to go around all 12 of them, right?

44
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,040
Yep, yep. We got one down two weeks ago in San Mateo.

45
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,600
We're here in Dallas, Texas.

46
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,040
It was a while getting here. We had some transmission issues.

47
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,920
Oh, really?

48
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,960
I mean, still haven't slept since we left to leave here two days ago.

49
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,960
So we're running on thin right now.

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,840
It's like you're really a rock star.

51
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,360
Yeah, that's what that feels like.

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,160
Oh, cool.

53
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,400
In that case, wow.

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,160
Well, there's some other things that go along with that, too.

55
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,280
Yeah, so it's been really good.

56
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,360
We're going to do the whole series and we've really been able to get our name out there

57
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,440
and we're booking more shows and, you know, we're doing what we really want to do,

58
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,040
which is entertain people on our bikes.

59
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,560
You know, that's what we've been working for years to be able to do.

60
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,280
And now that we have that ability and, you know, the option to do it.

61
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,760
Right. We're pushing for what you love for a living.

62
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,000
What a great idea.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,480
Well, we're going to go have a seat and watch the show.

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,520
And I wish you luck, man.

65
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
Hey, thanks a lot. Enjoy the show.

66
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,840
We need somebody to jump over this guy in.

67
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,600
Thanks a lot, man. Nice to meet you, Phil.

68
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,120
Thank you for watching.

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,560
Come on over to the tent, get some autographs for these guys.

70
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,200
We've got some free posters for you.

71
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,760
Get some of these awesome goat shirts we've got.

72
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,080
Give these guys a high five.

73
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,440
Give them a handshake. They're tired.
