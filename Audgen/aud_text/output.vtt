00:00.000 --> 00:10.720
Hey, Rex here with 2 in Oklahoma here in Dallas.

00:10.720 --> 00:13.200
I ran into Felipe Smadje.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.320
The Spanish trials rider.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.400
That's right.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.600
You may have seen these guys on America's Got Talent.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.240
How long have you guys been riding?

00:20.240 --> 00:25.680
We've been riding since we were around 10 or 11, so about 13 or 14 years.

00:25.680 --> 00:26.680
Wow, okay.

00:26.920 --> 00:32.320
Going to town for quite a while now, but to ride trials, it takes that long to even ride the bike.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.320
Exactly.

00:33.320 --> 00:37.760
It takes a long time, but once you get to that level, it's one of the most fun sports you can do.

00:37.760 --> 00:39.080
It is a lot of fun.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.160
It's great exercise, too.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.320
And I understand you guys compete, right?

00:42.320 --> 00:44.360
Yeah, we actually, I try to compete.

00:44.360 --> 00:46.160
My brother, he competes very well.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.800
He's the four time national champion.

00:48.800 --> 00:49.600
I hold my own.

00:49.600 --> 00:53.160
I ride pro class very long with him, but usually he's at the front of the pack.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.400
I'm just trying to beat a couple of guys.

00:55.440 --> 00:56.960
We're both in there, though, both competing.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.360
So what's been the reaction?

00:58.360 --> 01:03.560
I mean, I bet all the guys, like Sherco and Gas Gas, the guys that make trials bikes,

01:03.560 --> 01:06.160
probably just think you're the greatest thing to come along.

01:06.160 --> 01:09.560
I mean, have you increased awareness of the sport?

01:09.560 --> 01:12.120
Yeah, that was actually not only increased awareness of the sport,

01:12.120 --> 01:15.240
because that was one thing that we really shoot for, because I mean, we love the sport.

01:15.240 --> 01:15.920
We love to spread it.

01:15.920 --> 01:19.840
That's kind of why we travel around doing demos, I mean, to bring the sport to new people.

01:19.840 --> 01:22.960
And there's no better medium than national live television.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.800
So not only were we able to bring and grow what we're doing in our shows and our name,

01:27.800 --> 01:30.720
but also the sport of trials and then even motorcycle as a whole,

01:30.720 --> 01:33.480
because it's got a very negative aspect by a lot of the world.

01:33.480 --> 01:37.440
They think of motorcycles, they think of pollution, they think of death, they think of injury.

01:37.440 --> 01:40.960
And by what we did, we were able to bring it into a tight, confined area,

01:40.960 --> 01:43.120
indoor in a building in downtown L.A.

01:43.120 --> 01:47.160
So by jumping these barriers, we were able to open some eyes and make people realize

01:47.160 --> 01:49.000
that maybe the motorcycles aren't such a bad thing.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.560
And so that was a really big thing that we brought from the show is a really cool

01:52.560 --> 01:56.200
experience and to be able to open up people's eyes in that aspect was really awesome.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.080
And you scored a gig at like the International Motorcycle Show.

01:59.080 --> 02:01.120
And we're here after it, so you know, it was all good for sure.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.160
So you're going to go around all 12 of them, right?

02:03.160 --> 02:06.040
Yep, yep. We got one down two weeks ago in San Mateo.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.600
We're here in Dallas, Texas.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.040
It was a while getting here. We had some transmission issues.

02:11.040 --> 02:11.920
Oh, really?

02:11.920 --> 02:14.960
I mean, still haven't slept since we left to leave here two days ago.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.960
So we're running on thin right now.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.840
It's like you're really a rock star.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.360
Yeah, that's what that feels like.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.160
Oh, cool.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.400
In that case, wow.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.160
Well, there's some other things that go along with that, too.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.280
Yeah, so it's been really good.

02:28.280 --> 02:31.360
We're going to do the whole series and we've really been able to get our name out there

02:31.360 --> 02:34.440
and we're booking more shows and, you know, we're doing what we really want to do,

02:34.440 --> 02:36.040
which is entertain people on our bikes.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.560
You know, that's what we've been working for years to be able to do.

02:38.560 --> 02:42.280
And now that we have that ability and, you know, the option to do it.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.760
Right. We're pushing for what you love for a living.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.000
What a great idea.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.480
Well, we're going to go have a seat and watch the show.

02:48.480 --> 02:49.520
And I wish you luck, man.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.520
Hey, thanks a lot. Enjoy the show.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.840
We need somebody to jump over this guy in.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.600
Thanks a lot, man. Nice to meet you, Phil.

02:55.600 --> 02:59.120
Thank you for watching.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.560
Come on over to the tent, get some autographs for these guys.

03:01.560 --> 03:04.200
We've got some free posters for you.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.760
Get some of these awesome goat shirts we've got.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.080
Give these guys a high five.

03:08.080 --> 03:11.440
Give them a handshake. They're tired.
