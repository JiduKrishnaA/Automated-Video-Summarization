0	10720	Hey, Rex here with 2 in Oklahoma here in Dallas.
10720	13200	I ran into Felipe Smadje.
13200	14320	The Spanish trials rider.
14320	15400	That's right.
15400	17600	You may have seen these guys on America's Got Talent.
17600	20240	How long have you guys been riding?
20240	25680	We've been riding since we were around 10 or 11, so about 13 or 14 years.
25680	26680	Wow, okay.
26920	32320	Going to town for quite a while now, but to ride trials, it takes that long to even ride the bike.
32320	33320	Exactly.
33320	37760	It takes a long time, but once you get to that level, it's one of the most fun sports you can do.
37760	39080	It is a lot of fun.
39080	40160	It's great exercise, too.
40160	42320	And I understand you guys compete, right?
42320	44360	Yeah, we actually, I try to compete.
44360	46160	My brother, he competes very well.
46160	48800	He's the four time national champion.
48800	49600	I hold my own.
49600	53160	I ride pro class very long with him, but usually he's at the front of the pack.
53160	55400	I'm just trying to beat a couple of guys.
55440	56960	We're both in there, though, both competing.
56960	58360	So what's been the reaction?
58360	63560	I mean, I bet all the guys, like Sherco and Gas Gas, the guys that make trials bikes,
63560	66160	probably just think you're the greatest thing to come along.
66160	69560	I mean, have you increased awareness of the sport?
69560	72120	Yeah, that was actually not only increased awareness of the sport,
72120	75240	because that was one thing that we really shoot for, because I mean, we love the sport.
75240	75920	We love to spread it.
75920	79840	That's kind of why we travel around doing demos, I mean, to bring the sport to new people.
79840	82960	And there's no better medium than national live television.
83000	87800	So not only were we able to bring and grow what we're doing in our shows and our name,
87800	90720	but also the sport of trials and then even motorcycle as a whole,
90720	93480	because it's got a very negative aspect by a lot of the world.
93480	97440	They think of motorcycles, they think of pollution, they think of death, they think of injury.
97440	100960	And by what we did, we were able to bring it into a tight, confined area,
100960	103120	indoor in a building in downtown L.A.
103120	107160	So by jumping these barriers, we were able to open some eyes and make people realize
107160	109000	that maybe the motorcycles aren't such a bad thing.
109000	112560	And so that was a really big thing that we brought from the show is a really cool
112560	116200	experience and to be able to open up people's eyes in that aspect was really awesome.
116200	119080	And you scored a gig at like the International Motorcycle Show.
119080	121120	And we're here after it, so you know, it was all good for sure.
121120	123160	So you're going to go around all 12 of them, right?
123160	126040	Yep, yep. We got one down two weeks ago in San Mateo.
126040	128600	We're here in Dallas, Texas.
128600	131040	It was a while getting here. We had some transmission issues.
131040	131920	Oh, really?
131920	134960	I mean, still haven't slept since we left to leave here two days ago.
134960	136960	So we're running on thin right now.
136960	138840	It's like you're really a rock star.
138840	141360	Yeah, that's what that feels like.
141360	142160	Oh, cool.
142200	144400	In that case, wow.
144400	147160	Well, there's some other things that go along with that, too.
147160	148280	Yeah, so it's been really good.
148280	151360	We're going to do the whole series and we've really been able to get our name out there
151360	154440	and we're booking more shows and, you know, we're doing what we really want to do,
154440	156040	which is entertain people on our bikes.
156040	158560	You know, that's what we've been working for years to be able to do.
158560	162280	And now that we have that ability and, you know, the option to do it.
162280	164760	Right. We're pushing for what you love for a living.
164760	166000	What a great idea.
166000	168480	Well, we're going to go have a seat and watch the show.
168480	169520	And I wish you luck, man.
169520	171520	Hey, thanks a lot. Enjoy the show.
171560	173840	We need somebody to jump over this guy in.
173840	175600	Thanks a lot, man. Nice to meet you, Phil.
175600	179120	Thank you for watching.
179120	181560	Come on over to the tent, get some autographs for these guys.
181560	184200	We've got some free posters for you.
184200	186760	Get some of these awesome goat shirts we've got.
186760	188080	Give these guys a high five.
188080	191440	Give them a handshake. They're tired.
